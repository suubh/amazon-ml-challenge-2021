This is our submission for **Amazon ML Challenge 2021** on **Product Browse Node Classification** 
- Amazon catalog consists of billions of products that belong to thousands of browse nodes (each browse node represents a collection of items for sale). Browse nodes are used to help customers navigate through our website and classify products to product type groups. Hence, it is important to predict the node assignment at the time of listing of the product or when the browse node information is absent. 
 - Use product metadata to classify products into browse nodes.
